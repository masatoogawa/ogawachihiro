I'm happy to announce that I successfully passed the qualifying examination for the Certified Administrative Procedures Legal Specialist Training Course (特定行政書士法定研修考査試験), which I took last month. With this new role and responsibility in mind, I am committed to striving even harder to ensure the realization of the rights and interests of all my clients.

A Certified Administrative Procedures Legal Specialist (特定行政書士) is authorized not only to represent clients in the standard administrative application and permit procedures, but also to act as an agent in the appeal procedures when an administrative agency issues an unfavorable disposition, such as a refusal.

Furthermore, the revised Administrative Scrivener Act (改正行政書士法), which will take effect next year, includes an expansion of the scope of work for the Certified Administrative Procedures Legal Specialist. Traditionally, the power of representation was limited to appeals concerning "documents prepared by an Administrative Scrivener." This will be expanded to encompass appeals concerning all documents that an Administrative Scrivener is authorized to prepare. This change will allow a Certified Administrative Procedures Legal Specialist to act as an agent in appeal procedures—such as requests for administrative review or re-examination—related to documents originally prepared by the applicant themselves. This is expected to contribute to the relief and protection of citizens' rights and interests in a deeper and broader manner.
