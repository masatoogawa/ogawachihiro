I am pleased to announce that I have been registered as a **Copyright Consultant (著作権相談員)** with the Japan Federation of Administrative Scriveners Associations!

![Copyright Consultant Card](/blog/09282025/copyright-consultant-card.jpg)

A Copyright Consultant is an administrative scrivener who has completed the training curriculum established by the Japan Federation of Administrative Scriveners Associations, passed the prescribed examination, and is recognized as possessing the necessary knowledge for copyright application work.

Our names are entered into the Register of Copyright Consultants, which is then provided to relevant organizations, including the Agency for Cultural Affairs, the Copyright Research and Information Center, and the Software Information Center.

Before becoming an administrative scrivener, I was deeply involved in intellectual property practice as a Patent Administrator for approximately 18 years. The accurate knowledge of intellectual property overall, cultivated through these many years of experience, is a significant strength of my firm.

Now, combining this extensive experience with the specialized knowledge and enthusiasm gained from the recent Copyright Consultant training, I am committed to assisting clients in the field of copyright.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding copyright, please don't hesitate to contact me! I look forward to supporting your creative endeavors.
