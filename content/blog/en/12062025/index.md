I am pleased to announce that I have completed the "Course for Managers for Preventing Unjust Demands" designated by the Tokyo Metropolitan Public Safety Commission and received a certificate of completion from the Administrative Scrivener Association.

This course teaches legal knowledge and proper methods for dealing with unjust demands from anti-social forces and malicious complaints (customer harassment).

Lectures were provided by the Metropolitan Police Department and the Tokyo Center for Removal of Criminal Organizations. It was a very informative session that included real-life examples and recent trends regarding anti-social forces.

As a certified manager, I am required to take this course every three years. I am committed to continuously updating my knowledge of the latest cases and legal responses to ensure that my office remains a clean and reliable partner for my clients.
