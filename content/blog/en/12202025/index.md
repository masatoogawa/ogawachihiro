I am pleased to announce that I have successfully completed the required training course for supervisors to serve as an External Auditor under the Technical Intern Training Program.

As an External Auditor, I am committed to supporting the sound management of Supervising Organizations and ensuring the protection of technical interns by providing support from a neutral, third-party perspective.

Under the current regulations, Supervising Organizations are required to implement either checks by an External Director or audit measures by an External Auditor. However, under the new "Training and Employment System" (Ikusei Shuro), expected to be enforced around 2027, the appointment of an External Auditor is projected to become mandatory for "Supervision and Support Organizations" (the successors to the current Supervising Organizations).

Building a track record of audits under the current system will be a significant asset in establishing a smooth operational structure after the transition. I highly encourage you to consider appointing an External Auditor now, in preparation for the upcoming system changes.
